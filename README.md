air bnb clone 
the purpose of this project is to recreate the AirBnB site, from the back-end data management to the front-end user interface. 

The project is currently in its first phase, where we are creating a command line interpretor to access objects that will store user data. Users can use the console to create objects, update object attributes, remove objects, list all objects, and store and read data from a .json file.
